          </p>
          <p>
            Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921,
            Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding
            women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending
            untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule.
            Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark
            of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a
            self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and
            undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and
            political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the
            common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed
            salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in
            calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned
            many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious
            pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim
            nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within
            British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but
            the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a
            Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many
            displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new
            lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and
            Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence,
            Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate
            distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger
            strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these was
            begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78. The belief that
            Gandhi had been too resolute in his defense of both Pakistan and
            Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was
            Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western
            India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his
            chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.
            Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi
            Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International
            Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the
            Nation in post-colonial India.
